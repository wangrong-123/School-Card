# Overview of the school campus card program

## 1. Background
With the development of Internet information technology, the campus card is no longer a traditional campus pass, but an important part of the "information campus". Campus card replaces cash payment, identity authentication and school roll management in daily life, and gathers student information into a single card. The school coordinates with the bank network to dynamically grasp student information. Due to the high information exchange of the campus card, the school can realize the integration and processing of student data management, and can also analyze student dynamic data to make decisions beneficial to students. That's what this project is all about.
